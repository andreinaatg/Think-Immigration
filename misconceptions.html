  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Most Immigrants are here illegally.</h3>
  <p> Despite the debate that surrounds the issue of immigration today, most people tend to ignore that most foreign-born people who live in the United States do have permission to be here. According to the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of the foreign-born people who live here were naturalized US citizens. The remaining percent were lawful permanent residents (27 percent), or unauthorized immigrants (25.5 percent).  Furthermore, Canada has the highest amount of visitors who do not leave when their visas expire.

    We can stop undocumented immigrants from  coming to the US.</h3> </font>
<p>What many assume about undocumented immigrants coming into the US is that the majority come from Mexico. However, the number of Mexican immigrants living in the United States had declined significantly throughout the years. In fact, populations of immigrants that have increased have come from countries in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Central America. Thus, from this data, we can conclude that building a wall along the border between the US and Mexico will not prevent undocumented entry.

  <p><font color= "white"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Today’s immigrants don't want to learn English.</h3> </font> </p>
<p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, although most first-generation immigrants speak their primary language in their homes, 35% of those who are 5 or older speak English “very well.”

To become a naturalized citizen, one must write, read, speak, and understand the English language to pass the 100- question civics test and apply for the application process. Those thinking of immigrating to the U.S. must also overcome several obstacles such as paying lawyer fees, finding a job, and facing the constantly changing immigration bureaucracy.

  <font color= "black">   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Undocumented immigrants don’t pay taxes and are a burden to the nation</h3>
    <p>  According to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants pay approximately '11.74 billion in local and state taxes' in a year. Most people do not realize that undocumented immigrants pay taxes when purchasing taxable goods such as new appliances, gas, or clothes. Furthermore, they also contribute to the property taxes, which account for a significant source in school funding. These property taxes included buying or renting houses or apartments. Undocumented immigrants can receive emergency medical care and schooling; however, they cannot access welfare or food stamps due to the 1996 welfare law. In fact, even Immigrants with documents have to wait five years until they can access these benefits.

      <font color= "black">   <h3 style="text-align:center;">Immigrants take good jobs from U.S citizens</h3>
        <p>In the U.S., there lives a misconception that illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from U.S. citizens. However,  the 8 million unauthorized immigrants in the workforce represent only five percent of the total workforce. However, due to the lack of low-skilled U.S. workers, undocumented immigrants are over-represented in farming, construction occupations, and service. Employers are notorious for exploiting this labor source due to their ability in paying workers less, having the ability to ignore worker-safety laws and refusing to provide benefits. Looking from an economic level, the population tends to benefit from low prices in goods and food produced from the labor of undocumented immigrants.

        <p>The time that is takes for the government to approve refugees status is 18 to 24 months due to a large number of rigorous screenings. This process is extensive and meticulously; it includes fingerprint tests, interviews, health screenings, background checks, and several applications with security agencies.
